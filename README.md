<p>
<b>SakugaBot</b> is a Twitter bot dedicated for <a href="https://www.liveabout.com/sakuga-animation-in-anime-144807">sakuga animation</a> and its glorious beauty. I've seen countless Anime Twitter Accounts posting images and videos related to anime but I haven't seen any attempts of producing a bot that would regularly post videos to Twitter, other than <a href="https://twitter.com/randomsakuga">@randomsakuga</a>, one of the biggest anime accounts in social media. So I took it as a challenge for myself to recreate a bot that would handle such capabilities.

All medias posted on SakugaBot are taken from <a href="https://www.sakugabooru.com/post">SAKUGABOORU</a>, one of the biggest <i>booru</i> sites across the Internet.
